## The Story Behind the App

I'll be the first to tell you, this app has a long way to go. For a reason.

My two-player Battleship App was created for my third quarter project at Galvanize Austin. We were given a week to complete the project, with the intention of setting out to do something we would likely not be able to complete. Our ideas were vetted by our instructor to ensure they were difficult enough to be a real challenge, and had to involve a technology we did not know, and would have to teach ourselves.
