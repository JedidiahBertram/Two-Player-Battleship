## The Story Behind the App

I'll be the first to tell you, this app has a long way to go. For a reason.

My two-player Battleship App was created for my third quarter project at Galvanize Austin. We were given a week to complete the project, with the intention of setting out to do something we would likely not be able to complete. Our ideas were vetted by our instructor to ensure they were difficult enough to be a real challenge, and had to involve a technology we did not know, and would have to teach ourselves.

I picked Battleship because I'm a big board/tabletop game fan and it is one of my all time favorites. I also really enjoy thinking through game logic and making that work in code. Plus the idea of multiplayer always intrigued me.

This is where my unfamiliar technology came in with socket.io.

I spent the first four days of the project week studying how socket.io works. Going through two tutorials, and working through two projects before I attempted implementing it in my battleship app. Along the way I also learned about using redis to create a database, and why redis is advantages when using web sockets. Unfortunately, I did not get to the point of implimenting the knowledge of redis and express with socket.io, but plan on working on the project later when I get the opportunity and adding that functionality.

The other projects I worked through and used as a way of learning sockets were a canvas art app, and a chat app. If these were deployed, users could visit the site and draw together, or chat together, from completely separate computer. The following GIFs are examples of how they work. Notice that I am switching from tab to tab, simulating computer to computer/user to user functionality.
